#Fast and lightweight HTML/CSS rendering engine

The **litehtml** engine is created for embedding into applications, to show the HTML. **litehtml** supports most of the CSS2/CSS3 standards. The engine is written on C++ with STL.

**litehtml** is designed to simplify the integration library to an application. **litehtml** does not depend of any image/draw/font library. You are free to use any library to draw images, fonts and any other graphics. **litehtml** just places HTML elements into right places and gives you the information for draw elements.

##License

**litehtml** is distributed under [New BSD License](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause).

##Compatibility

First **litehtml** was developed on Windows (MS Visual Studio 2008) and for Windows platform for unicode strings. But now **litehtml** supports the strings in UTF-8 format. You can find the complete implementation of document_container class for linux (containers/linux/container_linux.\*). Also the simple browser is created with container_linux class.

##CSS properties and selectors support

**litehtml** supports the most CSS properties, but not all. You can find the list of supported properties in  [this table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvHXl5n24PuhdHdELUdhaUl4OGlncXhDcDJuM1JpMnc&usp=sharing).
